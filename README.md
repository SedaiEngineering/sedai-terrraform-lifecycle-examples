### S3 lifecycle
Currently, changes to the lifecycle_rule configuration of existing resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes of Lifecycle rules to an S3 bucket, use the aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration resource instead. If you use lifecycle_rule on an aws_s3_bucket, Terraform will assume management over the full set of Lifecycle rules for the S3 bucket, treating additional Lifecycle rules as drift. For this reason, lifecycle_rule cannot be mixed with the external aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration resource for a given S3 bucket. So if you don't have lifecycle_rule  configured in code there is no need to make any changes.

### Ignoring Changes to Desired Count ECS
You can utilize the generic Terraform resource lifecycle configuration block with ignore_changes to create an ECS service with an initial count of running instances, then ignore any changes to that count caused externally (e.g., Application Autoscaling).
